Spring Framework:-
        Advantages of this framework are - provides with logging , security, dependency injection, scheduling, batch processing and more.

Features:-

(i) Inversion of Control (IoC)
        Control given to the framework itself to take over the process of managing instances while we the developer can rely on business logic.
This process is possible through dependency injection.

(ii) Dependency Injection (DI)
        Allowing the classes to use objects of other classes in necessity. This way , the developer doesn't maintain the dependencies to be
suspended for using entities of classes.

(iii) Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP)
        Increases modularity by allowing the separation of cross-cutting(redundant job to be done) concerns.

(iv) Spring MVC
        For creating the web applications in Model-View-Controller template.

							Dependency Injection:-


    *Loose coupling helps in unit testing of modules which develops a code with multiple individual sections.

    *Dependency Injection helps in annotating these modules to provide Inversion of Control to the spring framework.

    *"pom.xml"(if Maven) consists all the dependencies that are available for the project. New dependencies can also be added to the same.

    *All the Beans(modules) are stored in @Container.

    *Interfaces available - Bean factory and Application Context.

    *Application context extends Bean Factory.
    
    *Use an instance of ApplicationContext for ClassPathXml that pulls the beans from the .xml main.resources
    
    (XML- Based)
    ------------
    *In .xml file define <Beans> from the official website and then start adding <Beans id="" class="">
    
    *Every bean must have its id for reference and class variable to the actual class to be made a bean.
    
    *The default values to be used for class variables can be injected through <properties> under <bean>
    
    *To inject the class.object within a class, you can use the ref="id" of the bean class to be injected as an object.
    
    *We can also inject the properties through the <constructor-arg> based injection for a class.
    
    (Annotations - based)
    ---------------------
    *use @Component above the class that you want to make a Bean.
    
    *Searching a bean : <context:component-scan base-package=""> provide with the package in which the component must be searched under 	<Beans>.
    
    (Java- Based)
    ---------------
    *Create a class for bean configurations, (say, "BeanConfig").
    
    *Annotate the class with @Configuration
    
    *Annotate with @ComponentScan(basePackage ="") to specify the location look for the component within the package.
    
    *For our own beanconfiguration we must instantiate the AnnotationConficApplicationContext(.class) from ApplicationContext.
    
    
Scope of Beans:
---------------

@Scope(scopename="<scope_name_here>")
@Component

->Singleton -*By default the Bean created are Singleton scope - only one instance can be craeted. 
->prototype -*Can have multiple instances of the Bean.
->Request   -*Scopes a bean defined to HTTP request. ('Web-aware' SpringAplicationContext)
->Session   -*Scopes a bean defined to HTTP session. ('Web-aware' SpringAplicationContext)
->Global-Session     -*Scopes a bean defined to a global HTTP session.


SingleTon - Only one object is created and the others are referenced to the same object (Shared properties).

Prototype - To get new object for every time we use the bean. 

Lifecycle of a bean
--------------------

1.Definition. - The configuration of a bean to be created

2.Instantiatiton. - Initiate an instance of the bean.

3.Population. - Define the properties of the bean that are explicitly defined by user.

4.Post initialization. - Interfaces are executed with their implemented classes to be determined on runtime(DMD).

5.Availability. - All the beans are successfully injected and are ready to be used from container.

6.Pre-destroy. -Defining the disconnectivity of a bean while cleaning up stuff(Manual cleanup).

7.Destruction. - Bean destroyed from the JVM itself.
